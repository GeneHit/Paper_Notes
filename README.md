This contains my notes for research papers that I've read. Papers are arranged according to two broad categories and then further numbered on a (1) to (5) scale where a (1) means I have only barely skimmed it, while a (5) means I feel confident that I understand almost everything about the paper. Within a single year, these papers should be organized according to publication date. The links here go to my paper summaries if I have them, otherwise those papers are on my TODO list.
